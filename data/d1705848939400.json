Four stages of COVID-19 have been identified: the first stage is characterised by upper respiratory tract infection; the second by the onset of dyspnoea and pneumonia; the third by a worsening clinical scenario dominated by a cytokine storm and the consequent hyperinflammatory state; and the fourth by death or recovery. Currently, no treatment can act specifically against the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on the pathological features and different clinical phases of COVID-19, particularly in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, the classes of drugs used are antiviral agents, inflammation inhibitors/antirheumatic drugs, low molecular weight heparins, plasma, and hyperimmune immunoglobulins. During this emergency period of the COVID-19 outbreak, clinical researchers are using and testing a variety of possible treatments. Based on these premises, this review aims to discuss the most updated pharmacological treatments to effectively act against the SARS-CoV-2 infection and support researchers and clinicians in relation to any current and future developments in curing COVID-19 patients.", "date": "2020 Dec 15"}, {"pmid": "33307513", "title": "COVID-19 and cancer: From basic mechanisms to vaccine development using nanotechnology.", "authors": ["Han, Hyun Jee", "Nwagwu, Chinekwu", "Anyim, Obumneme", "Ekweremadu, Chinedu", "Kim, San"], "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global pandemic which has induced unprecedented ramifications, severely affecting our society due to the long incubation time, unpredictably high prevalence and lack of effective vaccines. One of the interesting notions is that there is an association between COVID-19 and cancer. Cancer patients seem to exhibit exacerbated conditions and a higher mortality rate when exposed to the virus. Therefore, vaccines are the promising solution to minimise the problem amongst cancer patients threatened by the new viral strains. However, there are still limitations to be considered, including the efficacy of COVID vaccines for immunocompromised individuals, possible interactions between the vaccine and cancer, and personalised medicine. Not only to eradicate the pandemic, but also to make it more effective for immunocompromised patients who are suffering from cancer, a successful vaccine platform is required through the implementation of nanotechnology which can also enable scalable manufacturing and worldwide distribution along with its faster and precise delivery. In this review, we summarise the current understanding of COVID-19 with clinical perspectives, highlighting the association between COVID-19 and cancer, followed by a vaccine development for this association using nanotechnology. We suggest different administration methods for the COVID-19 vaccine formulation options.

SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that has become a major public health concern after the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and 2012, respectively. As of 29 October 2020, the total number of COVID-19 cases had reached over 44 million worldwide, with more than 1.17 million confirmed deaths. DISCUSSION: SARS-CoV-2 infected patients usually present with severe viral pneumonia. Similar to SARS-CoV, the virus enters respiratory tract cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2. The structural proteins play an essential role in budding the virus particles released from different host cells. To date, an approved vaccine or treatment option of a preventive character to avoid severe courses of COVID-19 is still not available.

This disease is caused by SARS-CoV-2 that was identified in Chinese patients having severe pneumonia and flu-like symptoms. COVID-19 is a contagious disease that spreads rapidly via droplet particles arising through sneezing and coughing action of an infected person. The reports of asymptomatic carriers changed the scenario of symptom based-diagnosis in COVID-19 and intensified the need for proper diagnosis of the majority of the population to combat the rapid transmission of virus. The diagnosis of positive cases is necessary to ensure prompt care to affected people and also to curb further spread of infection in the population. Collecting samples at the right time and from the exact anatomical site is crucial for proper molecular diagnosis. After the complete genome sequence was available, China formulated RT-PCR as a primary diagnostic procedure for detecting SARS-CoV-2. Many in-house and commercial diagnostic kits have been developed or are under development that have a potential to lower the burden of diagnosis on the primary diagnostic techniques like RT-PCR. Serological based diagnosis is another broad category of testing that can detect different serum antibodies like IgG, IgM, and IgA in an infected patient. PCR-based diagnostic procedures that are commonly used for pathogen detection need sophisticated machines and assistance of a technical expert. Despite their reliable accuracy, they are not cost-effective tests, which a common man can afford, so it becomes imperative to look for other diagnostic approaches, which could be cost effective, rapid, and sensitive with consistent accuracy. To make such diagnostics available to the common man, many techniques can be exploited among, which are Point of Care (POC), also known as bed side testing, which is developing as a portable and promising tool in pathogen diagnosis. Other lateral flow assay (LFA)-based techniques like SHERLOCK, CRISPR-Cas12a (AIOD-CRISPR), and FNCAS9 editor-limited uniform detection assay (FELUDA), etc. have shown promising results in rapid detection of pathogens. Diagnosis holds a critical importance in the pandemic situation when there is no potential drug for the pathogen available in the market.

These four stages are invasion; primary blockade of antiviral innate immunity; engagement of the virus's protection mechanisms against the factors of adaptive immunity; and acute, long-term complications of COVID-19. The invasion stage entails the recognition of the spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 target cell receptors, namely, the main receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, ACE2), its coreceptors, and potential alternative receptors. The presence of a diverse repertoire of receptors allows SARS-CoV-2 to infect various types of cells, including those not expressing ACE2. During the second stage, the majority of the polyfunctional structural, non-structural, and extra proteins SARS-CoV-2 synthesizes in infected cells are involved in the primary blockage of antiviral innate immunity. A high degree of redundancy and systemic action characterizing these pathogenic factors allows SARS-CoV-2 to overcome antiviral mechanisms at the initial stages of invasion. The third stage includes passive and active protection of the virus from factors of adaptive immunity, overcoming of the barrier function at the focus of inflammation, and generalization of SARS-CoV-2 in the body. The fourth stage is associated with the deployment of variants of acute and long-term complications of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2's ability to induce autoimmune and autoinflammatory pathways of tissue invasion and development of both immunosuppressive and hyperergic mechanisms of systemic inflammation is critical at this stage of infection.", "date": "2022 Feb 2"}, {"pmid": "33811458", "title": "Science's Response to CoVID-19.", "authors": ["Long, Marcus J C", "Aye, Yimon"], "abstract": "CoVID-19 is a multi-symptomatic disease which has made a global impact due to its ability to spread rapidly, and its relatively high mortality rate.

With pressure upon supply chains for the 'traditional' molecular approaches, a wide variety of analytical tools spanning the molecular, serology, imaging and chemistry space are being developed, including high throughput solutions and simplified near-patient formats. SUMMARY: The unique genetic nature of SARS-CoV-2 means high analytical specificity is achievable by most diagnostic formats. However, clinical sensitivity assessment is complicated by wide discrepancies in analytical range and challenges associated with standardising these differences. When coupled with the acute nature of SARS-CoV-2 infection, reported precise metrics of test performance must be questioned. The response to SARS-CoV-2 has delivered considerable diagnostic innovation, but for a technology to be maximised, it must be demonstrably reproducible and fit for purpose.

This disease has a potential to cause a significantly severe course of disease leading to respiratory complications, multiple organ failure and possibly death. In the fight against this pandemic-causing disease, medical professionals around the world are searching for pharmacological agents that could treat and prevent disease progression and mortality. To speed the search of promising treatment options, already existing pharmacological agents are repurposed for the potential treatment of COVID-19 and tested in clinical trials. The aim of this literature review is to investigate the efficacy and safety of repurposed pharmacological agents for the treatment of COVID-19 at different pathophysiologic stages of the disease. For this literature review, online-databases PubMed and Google Scholar were utilised. Keywords \"COVID-19\", \"SARS-CoV-2\", \"pathogenesis\", \"drug targets\", \"pharmacological treatment\", \"cytokine storm\", \"coagulopathy\" and individual drug names were used. Scientific articles, including reviews, clinical trials, and observational cohorts, were collected and analysed. Furthermore, these articles were examined for references to find more clinical trials testing for the potential treatment of COVID-19. In total, 97 references were used to conduct this research paper. RESULTS: The most beneficial pharmacological agent for the treatment of COVID-19 are corticosteroids, especially dexamethasone, for the treatment of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients. Other promising agents are remdesivir for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring minimal supplemental oxygen therapy, and IL-6 receptor antagonist monoclonal antibodies in severe COVID-19. Lopinavir/ritonavir, as well as chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin demonstrate the least efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. The clinical benefits of the treatment of a COVID-19-specific coagulopathy with increased dosing of anticoagulation need further research and confirmation of randomised controlled trials. CONCLUSION: The search for pharmacological treatment of COVID-19 has elicited great controversy. Whereas drugs like chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir/ritonavir have not shown proven benefit, the agents remdesivir and dexamethasone are recommended for clinical use for the treatment of COVID-19.

Activation of inflammatory signaling pathways and cytokine storm are crucial factors that lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients. Excessive secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines leads to the dysregulation of the innate immune system. The cytokine storm attracts many inflammatory cells that infiltrate into the lung tissues and ultimately cause immune damage. In addition to the dysregulation of the immune system, dysfunction of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) due to the downregulation of ACE2 is also associated with the mortality of COVID-19 patients. Both the mechanisms are directly or indirectly associated with cytokine storm that promotes vascular hyperpermeability, vascular edema leading to hypercoagulation and hence multiorgan damage. As of now, there is no specific treatment available for COVID-19, but scientists have purposed several treatment options including cytokine inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, immunomodulators, plasma therapy, etc. In this article, we have provided the detailed mechanism of occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammatory storm and its connection with the pre-existing inflammatory conditions.

Its impact on morbidity/mortality remains under investigation. In the current paper, analyzing and comparing the alterations of SARS-CoV-2 S RNA sequences in the defined variants (Alpha to Omicron), we observed some interesting findings regarding the S1-RBD/S2 mutation/deletion equilibrium that maybe affect and modify its activity.", "date": "2022 Mar 10"}, {"pmid": "37328559", "title": "'Bold' study that gave people COVID reveals 'supershedder' phenomenon.", "authors": [], "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: There are several types of research on the COVID-19 disease which have been conducting.

A surge in the case fatality ratio as compared with the infection ratio has been observed in most of the countries. The novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 shares the most common sequence with SARS-CoV, but it has a higher rate of transmission. The SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is initiated by the binding of viral spike protein with the target receptor Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) facilitating virus internalization within host cells. SARS-CoV-2 mainly causes alveolar damage ranging from mild to severe clinical respiratory manifestations. Most of the cases have revealed the association of Coronavirus disease with patients having earlier comorbidities like Hypertension, Diabetes mellitus, and Cerebrovascular diseases. Pharmacological investigation of the SARS-Cov-2 patients has revealed the frequent use of drugs belongs to Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and/or Angiotensin II type I receptor blockers (ARBs). Interestingly, a significant increase in ACE2 expression was noticed in patients routinely treated with the above group of drugs were also reported.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: England, United Kingdom, from 1 December 2021 to 30 December 2021. PARTICIPANTS: 1\u2009035\u2009149 people aged 18-100 years who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 under the national surveillance programme and had an infection identified as omicron BA.1 or delta compatible. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measure was covid-19 death as identified from death certification records. The exposure of interest was the SARS-CoV-2 variant identified from NHS Test and Trace PCR positive tests taken in the community (pillar 2) and analysed by Lighthouse laboratories. Cause specific Cox proportional hazard regression models (censoring non-covid-19 deaths) were adjusted for sex, age, vaccination status, previous infection, calendar time, ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation rank, household deprivation, university degree, keyworker status, country of birth, main language, region, disability, and comorbidities. Interactions between variant and sex, age, vaccination status, and comorbidities were also investigated. RESULTS: The risk of covid-19 death was 66% lower (95% confidence interval 54% to 75%) for omicron BA.1 compared with delta after adjusting for a wide range of potential confounders. The reduction in the risk of covid-19 death for omicron compared with delta was more pronounced in people aged 18-59 years (number of deaths: delta=46, omicron=11; hazard ratio 0.14, 95% confidence interval 0.07 to 0.27) than in those aged \u226570 years (number of deaths: delta=113, omicron=135; hazard ratio 0.44, 95% confidence interval 0.32 to 0.61, P<0.0001). No evidence of a difference in risk was found between variant and number of comorbidities.

METHODS: We performed a systematic review of Medline and Embase between December 1, 2019 and November 18, 2020 to identify case reports or series of patients who had COVID-19 diagnosed based on positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or serologic testing and had CSF testing due to a neurologic symptom. RESULTS: We identified 242 relevant documents which included 430 patients with COVID-19 who had acute neurological symptoms prompting CSF testing. Of those, 321 (75%) patients had symptoms that localized to the central nervous system (CNS). Of 304 patients whose CSF was tested for SARS-CoV-2 PCR, there were 17 (6%) whose test was positive, all of whom had symptoms that localized to the central nervous system (CNS). The majority (13/17, 76%) of these patients were admitted to the hospital because of neurological symptoms. Of 58 patients whose CSF was tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibody, 7 (12%) had positive antibodies with evidence of intrathecal synthesis, all of whom had symptoms that localized to the CNS. Of 132 patients who had oligoclonal bands evaluated, 3 (2%) had evidence of intrathecal antibody synthesis. Of 77 patients tested for autoimmune antibodies in the CSF, 4 (5%) had positive findings. CONCLUSION: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in CSF via PCR or evaluation for intrathecal antibody synthesis appears to be rare.

Djibouti worked with WHO and other partners to develop a preparedness and response plan, and implemented a series of intervention measures. MoH together with its civilian and military partners, closely followed WHO recommended strategy based on four pillars: testing, isolating, early case management, and contact tracing. From 17 March to 16 May, Djibouti performed the highest per capita tests in Africa and isolated, treated and traced the contacts of each positive case, which allowed for a rapid control of the epidemic. COVID-19 data included in this study was collected through MoH Djibouti during the period from 17 March to 16 May 2020.

Djibouti conducted 17,532 tests, and was considered as a champion for COVID-19 testing in Africa with 18.2 tests per 1000 habitant. All positive cases were isolated, treated and had their contacts traced, which led to early and proactive diagnosis of cases and in turn yielded up to 95-98% asymptomatic cases. Recoveries reached 69% of the infected cases with R0 (0.91). The virus was detected in 4 regions in the country, with the highest percentage in the capital (83%).

Second, this effect depends on an individual's temporal perspective. People can safeguard their self-authenticity in the face of changing social roles if they stay focused on the here-and-now (the present and immediate future), rather than focusing on the past (pre-COVID-19) or future (post-COVID-19) (Studies 3 & 4). This advantage for present-focused coping is observed in both the U.S.A. (Study 3) and Hong Kong (Study 4). We suggest that the reason people feel more authentically themselves when they maintain a present focus is because doing so makes the discontinuity of their social roles less salient.", "date": "2021"}, {"pmid": "34815503", "title": "Comparing the clinical efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.", "authors": ["Rotshild, Victoria", "Hirsh-Raccah, Bruria", "Miskin, Ian", "Muszkat, Mordechai", "Matok, Ilan"], "abstract": "New Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines are available to prevent the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome\u00a0coronavirus\u00a02 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. We compared the efficacy of new COVID-19 vaccines to prevent symptomatic and severe disease in the adult population and to prevent symptomatic COVID-19 among the elderly. Leading medical databases were searched until August 30, 2021. Published phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated efficacy of the vaccine to prevent symptomatic and sever COVID-19 in adults were included. Two reviewers independently evaluated the literature search results and independently extracted summary data. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. We performed a network meta-analysis (NMA) according to PRISMA-NMA 2015 to pool indirect comparisons between different vaccines regarding their relative efficacy. The primary outcomes were the efficacy of the vaccine against symptomatic COVID-19 in adults (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42021235364). Above 200,000 adult participants from eight phase 3 RCTs were included in NMA, of whom 52% received the intervention (active COVID-19 vaccine). While each of nine vaccines was tested in the unique clinical trial as compared to control, based on indirect comparison, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines were ranked with the highest probability of efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 (P-scores 0.952 and 0.843, respectively), followed by Gam-COVID-Vac (P-score 0.782), NVX-CoV23730 (P-score 0.700), CoronaVac (P-score 0.570), BN02 (P-score 0.428), WIV04 (P-score 0.327), and Ad26.COV2.S (P-score 0.198). No statistically significant difference was seen in the ability of the vaccines to prevent symptomatic disease in the elderly population. No vaccine was statistically significantly associated with a decreased risk for severe COVID-19 than other vaccines, although mRNA-1273 and Gam-COVID-Vac have the highest P-scores (0.899 and 0.816, respectively), indicating greater protection against severe disease than other vaccines. In our indirect comparison, the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines, which use mRNA technology, were associated with the highest efficacy to prevent symptomatic COVID-19 compared to other vaccines.

This study analyses the temporal dynamic of detected vs. undetected cases to provide guidance for the interpretation of prevalence studies performed with PCR or antibody tests to estimate the detection rate. METHODS: We used an agent-based model to evaluate assumptions on the detection probability ranging from 0.1 to 0.9. For each general detection probability, we derived age-dependent detection probabilities and calibrated the model to reproduce the epidemic wave of COVID-19 in Austria from March 2020 to June 2020. We categorized infected individuals into presymptomatic, symptomatic unconfirmed, confirmed and never detected to observe the simulated dynamic of the detected and undetected cases. RESULTS: The calculation of the age-dependent detection probability ruled values lower than 0.4 as most likely. Furthermore, the proportion of undetected cases depends strongly on the dynamic of the epidemic wave: during the initial upswing, the undetected cases account for a major part of all infected individuals, whereas their share decreases around the peak of the confirmed cases. CONCLUSIONS: The results of prevalence studies performed to determine the detection rate of COVID-19 patients should always be interpreted with regard to the current dynamic of the epidemic wave. Applying the method proposed in our analysis, the prevalence study performed in Austria in April 2020 could indicate a detection rate of 0.13, instead of the prevalent ratio of 0.29 between detected and estimated undetected cases at that time.", "date": "2021 Jan 13"}, {"pmid": "34291285", "title": "Biochemical composition, transmission and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2.", "authors": ["Ahirwar, Rajesh", "Gandhi, Sonu", "Komal, Komal", "Dhaniya, Geeta", "Tripathi, Prem Prakash", "Shingatgeri, Vyas Madhavrao", "Kumar, Krishan", "Sharma, Jai Gopal", "Kumar, Saroj"], "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a life-threatening respiratory infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV-2), a novel human coronavirus.

The SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster than its two ancestors, the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) but has reduced fatality. At present, the SARS-CoV-2 has caused about 1.16 million deaths with more than 43.4 million confirmed cases worldwide, resulting in a serious threat to public health globally with yet uncertain impact. The disease is transmitted by inhalation or direct contact with an infected person. The incubation period ranges from 1 to 14 days. COVID-19 is accompanied by various symptoms, including cough and fatigue. In most people, the disease is mild, but in some other people, such as in the elderly and people with chronic diseases, it may progress from pneumonia to a multi-organ dysfunction. Many people are reported asymptomatic. The virus genome is sequenced, but new variants are reported. Numerous biochemical aspects of its structure and function are revealed. To date, no clinically approved vaccines and/or specific therapeutic drugs are available to prevent or treat COVID-19.

To investigate how overdispersion might affect the outcome of various mitigation strategies, we developed an agent-based model with a social network that allows transmission through contact in three sectors: \"close\" (a small, unchanging group of mutual contacts as might be found in a household), \"regular\" (a larger, unchanging group as might be found in a workplace or school), and \"random\" (drawn from the entire model population and not repeated regularly). We assigned individual infectivity from a gamma distribution with dispersion parameter k We found that when k was low (i.e., greater heterogeneity, more superspreading events), reducing random sector contacts had a far greater impact on the epidemic trajectory than did reducing regular contacts; when k was high (i.e., less heterogeneity, no superspreading events), that difference disappeared.

While a significant amount of effort is focused on developing a vaccine in order to make a game-changing anti-COVID-19 breakthrough, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is also developing mutations rapidly as it transmits just like any other virus and there is always a substantial chance of the invented antibodies becoming ineffective as a function of time, thus failing to inhibit virus-to-cell binding efficiency as the spiked protein keeps evolving.

Five SARS-CoV-2 proteins, namely nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and accessory proteins Orf3, Orf7a, and Orf7b were found to be novel clients of Hsp90\u03b2 in particular. Pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90 with 17-DMAG results in N protein proteasome-dependent degradation. Hsp90 depletion-induced N protein degradation is independent of CHIP, a ubiquitin E3 ligase previously identified for Hsp90 client proteins, but alleviated by FBXO10, an E3 ligase identified by subsequent siRNA screening. We also provide evidence that Hsp90 depletion may suppress SARS-CoV-2 assembly partially through induced M or N degradation.

False positives exceed true positives at prevalence lower than 5.3%, or if sensitivity is improved to 100% and specificity to 98%, at prevalence lower than 2%. Recursive testing improves predictive value. Three tiers emerged from these results. With 100% sensitivity, physicians can select desired predictive values, then input local prevalence, to determine suitable specificity. CONCLUSIONS.\u2014: Understanding low prevalence impact will help health care providers meet COVID-19 needs for effective testing. Laypersons should receive clinical performance disclosure when submitting specimens. Home testing needs to meet the same high standards as other tests. In the long run, it will be more cost-effective to improve COVID-19 point-of-care tests rather than repeat testing multiple times.", "date": "2021 Mar 1"}, {"pmid": "33491180", "title": "World Cancer Day 2021: A recognition of the COVID-19 heroes supporting and caring for cancer patients around the world.", "authors": [], "abstract": "COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, manifests with a wide range of clinical symptoms that vary from mild respiratory issues to severe respiratory distress.

To prevent harm and disadvantages for children and adolescents, but also adults, detailed data on school outbreaks is needed, especially when talking about open schools employing evidence-based safety concepts. Here, we investigated the first significant COVID-19 school outbreak in Hamburg, Germany, after the re-opening of schools in 2020. Using clinical, laboratory, and contact data and spatial measures for epidemiological and environmental studies combined with whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis, we examined the causes and the course of the secondary school outbreak. The potential index case was identified by epidemiological tracking and the lessons in classrooms with presumably high virus spreading rates and further infection chains in the setting. Sequence analysis of samples detected one sample of a different virus lineage and 25 virus genomes with almost identical sequences, of which 21 showed 100% similarity. Most infections occurred in connection with two lesson units of the primary case. Likely, 31 students (12-14 years old), two staff members, and three family members were infected in the school or the typical household. Sequence analysis revealed an outbreak cluster with a single source that was epidemiologically identified as a member of the educational staff.

While most such studies have focused on China, neighboring Asian counties, Western Europe, and North America, there is a scarcity of studies for Eastern Europe. The aim of this epidemiological study is to fill this gap by analyzing the characteristics of the first months of the epidemic in Ukraine using agent-based modelling and phylodynamics. Specifically, first we studied the dynamics of COVID-19 incidence and mortality and explored the impact of epidemic NPIs. Our stochastic model suggests, that even a small delay of weeks could have increased the number of cases by up to 50%, with the potential to overwhelm hospital systems. Second, the genomic data analysis suggests that there have been multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Ukraine during the early stages of the epidemic.

Our results show that the mean number of measured direct contacts per visitor was nine persons and this can be reduced substantially by appropriate hygiene practices. A comparison of two versions of ventilation with different air exchange rates and different airflows found that the system which performed worst allowed a ten-fold increase in the number of individuals exposed to infectious aerosols. The overall burden of infections resulting from indoor mass gatherings depends largely on the quality of the ventilation system and the hygiene practices.

Specifically, this framework is applied to estimate the instantaneous reproduction number Rt during emerging epidemics, resulting in the state-of-the-art 'DARt' system. With DARt, time misalignment caused by lagging observations is tackled by incorporating observation delays into the joint inference of infections and Rt; the drawback of averaging is overcome by instantaneously updating upon new observations and developing a model selection mechanism that captures abrupt changes; the uncertainty is quantified and reduced by employing Bayesian smoothing.

However, there is an upper bound on daily testing volume because of limited healthcare staff and working hours, as well as different testing methods, such as random testing and contact-tracking testing. In this study, a network-based epidemic transmission model combined with a testing mechanism was proposed to study the role of testing in epidemic control. The aim of this study was to determine how testing affects the spread of epidemics and the daily testing volume needed to control infectious diseases. METHODS: We simulated the epidemic spread process on complex networks and introduced testing preferences to describe different testing strategies. Different networks were generated to represent social contact between individuals. An extended susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) epidemic model was adopted to simulate the spread of epidemics in these networks. The model establishes a testing preference of between 0 and 1; the larger the testing preference, the higher the testing priority for people in close contact with confirmed cases. RESULTS: The numerical simulations revealed that the higher the priority for testing individuals in close contact with confirmed cases, the smaller the infection scale. In addition, the infection peak decreased with an increase in daily testing volume and increased as the testing start time was delayed. We also discovered that when testing and other measures were adopted, the daily testing volume required to keep the infection scale below 5% was reduced by more than 40% even if other measures only reduced individuals' infection probability by 10%. The proposed model was validated using COVID-19 testing data. CONCLUSIONS: Although testing could effectively inhibit the spread of infectious diseases and epidemics, our results indicated that it requires a huge daily testing volume.

Although the introduction of public health measures, vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics disrupted the spread of the SARS-CoV-2, the emergence of variants poses substantial threat. This study traced SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in Uganda by July 2021 to inform the necessity for refinement of the intervention medical products. A comprehensive in silico analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes detected in clinical samples collected from COVID-19 patients in Uganda revealed occurrence of structural protein variants with potential of escaping detection, resisting antibody therapy, or increased infectivity. The genome sequence dataset was retrieved from the GISAID database and the open reading frame encoding the spike, envelope, membrane, or nucleocapsid proteins was translated. The obtained protein sequences were aligned and inspected for existence of variants. The variant positions on each of the four alignment sets were mapped on predicted epitopes as well as the 3D structures. Additionally, sequences within each of the sets were clustered by family. A phylogenetic tree was constructed to assess relationship between the encountered spike protein sequences and Wuhan-Hu-1 wild-type, or the Alpha, Beta, Delta and Gamma variants of concern. Strikingly, the frequency of each of the spike protein point mutations F157L/Del, D614G and P681H/R was over 50%. The furin and the transmembrane serine protease 2 cleavage sites were unaffected by mutation. Whereas the Delta dominated the spike sequences (16.5%, 91/550), Gamma was not detected. The envelope protein was the most conserved with 96.3% (525/545) sequences being wild-type followed by membrane at 68.4% (397/580). Although the nucleocapsid protein sequences varied, the variant residue positions were less concentrated at the RNA binding domains.

Theory predicts a group-structured population with selection acting principally at two levels: the pathogen individuals and the group of pathogens within a single host individual. Rapid replication of individual viruses is selected for, but if this replication debilitates the host before transmission occurs, the entire group of viruses in that host may perish. Thus, rapid transmission can favor more pathogenic strains, while slower transmission can favor less pathogenic strains. Available data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may follow this pattern. Indeed, high population density and other circumstances that favor rapid transmission may also favor more deadly strains. Health care workers, exposed to pathogenic strains of hospitalized patients, may be at greater risk.

A vaccine made with one strain may confer limited immunity to other strains. Variation among strains may lead to the rapid evolution of resistance to therapeutics.

Thus, assays for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in blood, validated on commercially available polymerase chain reaction (PCR) systems, are required to allow a good comparability of data. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The cobas SARS-CoV-2 dual-target reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assay, licensed for respiratory swab SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing, was validated for detection of viral RNA in blood. For the validation panel, SARS-CoV-2-positive plasma samples were prepared by spiking SARS-CoV-2-positive respiratory specimens in negative human plasma. The 95% limit of detection (LOD95) was determined by probit analysis. For clinical validation, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent plasma (CCP) donors and patients with COVID-19 with a severe disease course treated in an intensive care unit (ICU) were included. RESULTS: The validation of the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay for blood demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity and intra- and inter-assay precision and efficiency. The LOD95 for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was 5.0 genome copies/mL (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.3-12 copies/mL) for target 1 and 4.3 genome copies/mL (95% CI, 2.9-10 copies/mL) for target 2. In a cohort of 39 CCP donors with 66 CCP donations no SARS-CoV-2 RNA in plasma was detected. Screening of 25 blood samples of 19 ICU patients with COVID-19 showed six positive results for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in at least one target of the assay.

The longer high levels of viral multiplication occur - permitted by high levels of transmission -, the more the virus can adapt to the human host and find ways to success. The third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic is starting in different parts of the world, emphasizing that transmission containment measures that are being imposed are not adequate. Part of the consideration in determining containment measures is the rationale that vaccination will soon stop transmission and allow a return to normality. However, vaccines themselves represent a selection pressure for evolution of vaccine-resistant variants, so the coupling of a policy of permitting high levels of transmission/virus multiplication during vaccine roll-out with the expectation that vaccines will deal with the pandemic, is unrealistic. In the absence of effective antivirals, it is not improbable that SARS-CoV-2 infection prophylaxis will involve an annual vaccination campaign against 'dominant' viral variants, similar to influenza prophylaxis. Living with COVID-19 will be an issue of SARS-CoV-2 variants and evolution. It is therefore crucial to understand how SARS-CoV-2 evolves and what constrains its evolution, in order to anticipate the variants that will emerge. Thus far, the focus has been on the receptor-binding spike protein, but the virus is complex, encoding 26 proteins which interact with a large number of host factors, so the possibilities for evolution are manifold and not predictable a priori. However, if we are to mount the best defence against COVID-19, we must mount it against the variants, and to do this, we must have knowledge about the evolutionary possibilities of the virus. In addition to the generic cellular interactions of the virus, there are extensive polymorphisms in humans (e.g. Lewis, HLA, etc.), some distributed within most or all populations, some restricted to specific ethnic populations and these variations pose additional opportunities for/constraints on viral evolution. We now have the wherewithal - viral genome sequencing, protein structure determination/modelling, protein interaction analysis - to functionally characterize viral variants, but access to comprehensive genome data is extremely uneven. Yet, to develop an understanding of the impacts of such evolution on transmission and disease, we must link it to transmission (viral epidemiology) and disease data (patient clinical data), and the population granularities of these. In this editorial, we explore key facets of viral biology and the influence of relevant aspects of human polymorphisms, human behaviour, geography and climate and, based on this, derive a series of recommendations to monitor viral evolution and predict the types of variants that are likely to arise.", "date": "2021 May"}, {"pmid": "33153824", "title": "Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in the air of an ICU dedicated to covid-19 patients.", "authors": [], "abstract": "Infectious diseases, especially viral infections, have emerged as a major concern for public health in recent years.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) first emerged in Guangdong, China in 2002 and spread to 29 countries, infecting 8089 individuals and causing 774 deaths. In 2012, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in Saudi Arabia and has spread to 27 countries, with a mortality rate of ~34%. In 2019, SARS-CoV-2 emerged and has spread to 220 countries, infecting over 100,000,000 people and causing more than 2,000,000 deaths to date. These three human coronaviruses cause diseases of varying severity. Most people develop mild, common cold-like symptoms, while some develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The success of all viruses, including coronaviruses, relies on their evolved abilities to evade and modulate the host anti-viral and pro-inflammatory immune responses. However, we still do not fully understand the transmission, phylogeny, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 and -2. Despite the rapid application of a range of therapies for SARS-CoV-2, such as convalescent plasma, remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine and type I interferon, no fully effective treatment has been determined. Remarkably, COVID-19 vaccine research and development have produced several offerings that are now been administered worldwide.

The most frequently reported pathology is conjunctivitis, which may be the first or only clinical manifestation of the disease. Involvement of SARS-CoV-2 in development of alterations in other ocular structures was suggested, including the cornea, the retina, and blood vessels. Possible mechanisms include direct activity of the viral agent, as well as systemic inflammatory response with accompanying thromboembolic complications. Genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in ocular secretions of infected individuals, including asymptomatic patients. Moreover, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor protein used by the virus to enter the cell, has been found on the surface of various structures of the eye, which indicates a risk of transmission through ocular tissues. Therefore, it is crucial to use eye protection by medical professionals having contact with potentially infected patients. This paper is a review of the literature regarding ocular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection and a summary of the current state of knowledge about possibility of transmission from an ophthalmology point of view. For data collection, a thorough PubMed search was performed, using the key words: \"COVID ocular\", \"COVID eye\", \"SARS-CoV-2 ocular\", and \"SARS-CoV-2 eye\". Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection may manifest itself in various ocular conditions. Eye protection should not be neglected, as recent studies suggest the eye as a potential route of transmission.

This Review examines the influence of viruses on the host epigenome. We describe general lessons and methodologies that can be used to understand how the virus evades the host immune response. We consider how variation in the epigenome may contribute to heterogeneity in the response to SARS-CoV-2 and may identify a precision medicine approach to treatment.", "date": "2021 Feb 1"}, {"pmid": "33361715", "title": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus-2 infection: A review of the clinical-pathological correlations of Coronavirus disease-19 in children.", "authors": ["Teo, J T R", "Abidin, N H", "Cheah, F C"], "abstract": "The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic of acute respiratory disease in just less than a year by the middle of 2020. This disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in significant mortality especially among the older age population and those with health co-morbidities. In contrast, children are relatively spared of this potentially ravaging disease that culminates in the acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and death. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces exuberant release of pro-inflammatory mediators, causing a \"cytokine storm\" and hypercoagulable states that underlie these complications. The SARS-CoV-2 infection median incubation is 5.1 days, with most developing symptoms by 11.5 days. It is highly infectious, spreading via the horizontal mode of transmission, but there is yet very limited evidence of vertical transmission to the newborn infant occurring either transplacentally or through breastfeeding. This said, various immune factors during childhood may modulate the expression of COVID-19, with the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) at the severe end of the disease spectrum. This article gives an overview of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinical presentation and laboratory tests of COVID-19 and correlating with the current understanding of the pathological basis of this disease in the paediatric population.", "date": "2020 Dec"}, {"pmid": "33596214", "title": "Evidence and magnitude of the effects of meteorological changes on SARS-CoV-2 transmission.", "authors": ["Kaplin, Adam", "Junker, Caesar", "Kumar, Anupama", "Ribeiro, Mary Anne", "Yu, Eileen", "Wang, Michael", "Smith, Ted", "Rai, Shesh N", "Bhatnagar, Aruni"], "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Intensity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and planning required to balance concerns of saving lives and avoiding economic collapse, could depend significantly on whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission is sensitive to seasonal changes. OBJECTIVE: Hypothesis is that increasing temperature results in reduced SARS CoV-2 transmission and may help slow the increase of cases over time. SETTING: Fifty representative Northern Hemisphere countries meeting specific criteria had sufficient COVID-19 case and meteorological data for analysis. METHODS: Regression was used to find the relationship between the log of number of COVID-19 cases and temperature over time in 50 representative countries. To summarize the day-day variability, and reduce dimensionality, we selected a robust measure, Coefficient of Time (CT), for each location. The resulting regression coefficients were then used in a multivariable regression against meteorological, country-level and demographic covariates. RESULTS: Median minimum daily temperature showed the strongest correlation with the reciprocal of CT (which can be considered as a rate associated with doubling time) for confirmed cases (adjusted R2 = 0.610, p = 1.45E-06). A similar correlation was found using median daily dewpoint, which was highly colinear with temperature, and therefore was not used in the analysis. The correlation between minimum median temperature and the rate of increase of the log of confirmed cases was 47% and 45% greater than for cases of death and recovered cases of COVID-19, respectively. This suggests the primary influence of temperature is on SARS-CoV-2 transmission more than COVID-19 morbidity. Based on the correlation between temperature and the rate of increase in COVID-19, it can be estimated that, between the range of 30 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit, a one degree increase is associated with a 1% decrease-and a one degree decrease could be associated with a 3.7% increase-in the rate of increase of the log of daily confirmed cases. This model of the effect of decreasing temperatures can only be verified over time as the pandemic proceeds through colder months. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that boreal summer months are associated with slower rates of COVID-19 transmission, consistent with the behavior of a seasonal respiratory virus. Knowledge of COVID-19 seasonality could prove useful in local planning for phased reductions social interventions and help to prepare for the timing of possible pandemic resurgence during cooler months.", "date": "2021"}, {"pmid": "33834961", "title": "Determining the communicable period of SARS-CoV-2: A rapid review of the literature, March to September 2020.", "authors": ["Park, Mina", "Pawliuk, Colleen", "Nguyen, Tribesty", "Griffitt, Amanda", "Dix-Cooper, Linda", "Fourik, Nadia", "Dawes, Martin"], "abstract": "IntroductionStandard testing for infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is based on RT-PCR tests, but detection of viral genetic material alone does not indicate ongoing infectious potential. The ability to isolate whole virus represents a better proxy for infectivity.AimThe objective of this study was to gain an understanding of the current literature and compare the reported periods of positive SARS-CoV-2 detection from studies that conducted RT-PCR testing in addition to experiments isolating whole virus.MethodsUsing a rapid review approach, studies reporting empirical data on the duration of positive RT-PCR results and/or successful viral isolation following SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans were identified through searches of peer-reviewed and pre-print health sciences literature. Articles were screened for relevance, then data were extracted, analysed, and synthesised.ResultsOf the 160 studies included for qualitative analysis, 84% (n\u2009=\u2009135) investigated duration of positive RT-PCR tests only, 5% (n\u2009=\u20098) investigated duration of successful viral isolations, while 11% (n\u2009=\u200917) included measurements on both. There was significant heterogeneity in reported data. There was a prolonged time to viral clearance when deduced from RT-PCR tests compared with viral isolations (median: 26 vs 9 days).DiscussionFindings from this review support a minimum 10-day period of isolation but certain cases where virus was isolated after 10 days were identified. Given the extended time to viral clearance from RT-PCR tests, future research should ensure standard reporting of RT-PCR protocols and results to help inform testing policies aimed at clearance from isolation.", "date": "2021 Apr"}, {"pmid": "36693967", "title": "The next worrisome coronavirus variant could come from China - will it get detected?", "authors": [], "abstract": "A biochemistry class was transformed to implement student-centered, active-learning pedagogies to help improve competencies associated with the scientific method.

Vaccine efficacy against transmissibility given infection (VE(INF)), the decrease in secondary transmissions from infected vaccine recipients, is also not measured. Using mathematical modeling of data from King County Washington, we demonstrate that if the Moderna (mRNA-1273QS) and Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccines, which demonstrated VE(DIS) > 90% in clinical trials, mediate VE(DIS) by VE(SUSC), then a limited fourth epidemic wave of infections with the highly infectious B.1.1.7 variant would have been predicted in spring 2021 assuming rapid vaccine roll out. If high VE(DIS) is explained by VE(SYMP), then high VE(INF) would have also been necessary to limit the extent of this fourth wave. Vaccines which completely protect against infection or secondary transmission also substantially lower the number of people who must be vaccinated before the herd immunity threshold is reached. The limited extent of the fourth wave suggests that the vaccines have either high VE(SUSC) or both high VE(SYMP) and high VE(INF) against B.1.1.7. Finally, using a separate intra-host mathematical model of viral kinetics, we demonstrate that a 0.6 log vaccine-mediated reduction in average peak viral load might be sufficient to achieve 50% VE(INF,) which suggests that human challenge studies with a relatively low number of infected participants could be employed to estimate all three vaccine efficacy metrics.", "date": "2021 Sep 24"}, {"pmid": "32978802", "title": "Characterization of 100 sequential SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma donations.", "authors": ["Jungbauer, Christof", "Weseslindtner, Lukas", "Weidner, Lisa", "G\u00e4nsdorfer, Simon", "Farcet, Maria R", "Gschaider-Reichhart, Eva", "Kreil, Thomas R"], "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Transfusion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) convalescent plasma is a promising treatment for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, with success of the intervention based on neutralizing antibody content. Measurement by serologic correlates without biocontainment needs as well as an understanding of donor characteristics that may allow for targeting of more potent donors would greatly facilitate effective collection. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred convalescent plasma units were characterized for functionally active SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, as well as for SARS-CoV-2 binding antibodies, with the intention to establish a correlation between the functionally more relevant neutralization assay and the more accessible enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Donor demographics such as COVID-19 severity, age, and sex were correlated with antibody titers. RESULTS: A mean neutralization titer 50% of 230 (range, <8-1765) was seen for the 100 convalescent plasma units, with highly significant (P\u2009<\u2009.0001) yet quantitatively limited (R(2) = 0.2830) correlation with results of the ELISA. Exclusion of units with particularly high titers (>500) from analysis improved correlation (R(2) = 0.5386).

CONCLUSION: The ELISA-based correlation to neutralization titer enabled a threshold proposal that could be used to eliminate lower-titer units from the clinical supply for COVID-19 treatment.

To date, no study has been published on viral kinetics during the preclinical and clinical periods of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: A confirmed case was defined as a patient with positive results by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for SARS-CoV-2. Both specimen types were collected over the whole clinical course in all patients. Asymptomatic patients who had been screened for COVID-19 due to a strong epidemiological link were also enrolled. The study population included 54 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: COVID-19 shows a very high viral load on the day of symptom development, which then decreases overall. Rapid viral proliferation was observed 0-5 days before symptoms developed. Cycle threshold (Ct) value was the lowest in the clinical course from 5 days before symptoms to 10 days after symptoms occurred (Ct < 30). The rRT-PCR results were negative approximately 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms. However, there was a continuous pattern that was negative and positive for up to 6 weeks and more. CONCLUSION: Considering the characteristic that COVID-19 has a high viral load before symptoms appear, it is necessary to consider to expand the scope of epidemiological investigations. As there is a very low possibility of transmission after 10 days of symptom occurrence, it may be considered to release isolation after 10 days of symptom occurrence in limited resource situations. This study allows for the planning of epidemiological investigations, patient's ward supply, and follow-up of patients through sequential changes in viral loads over the entire clinical course. In addition, it is possible to estimate the clinical time at which the patient is present.", "date": "2021 Jan"}, {"pmid": "34376689", "title": "Tracking the introduction and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in coastal Kenya.", "authors": ["Githinji, George", "de Laurent, Zaydah R", "Mohammed, Khadija Said", "Omuoyo, Donwilliams O", "Macharia, Peter M", "Morobe, John M", "Otieno, Edward", "Kinyanjui, Samson M", "Agweyu, Ambrose", "Maitha, Eric", "Kitole, Ben", "Suleiman, Thani", "Mwakinangu, Mohamed", "Nyambu, John", "Otieno, John", "Salim, Barke", "Kasera, Kadondi", "Kiiru, John", "Aman, Rashid", "Barasa, Edwine", "Warimwe, George", "Bejon, Philip", "Tsofa, Benjamin", "Ochola-Oyier, Lynette Isabella", "Nokes, D James", "Agoti, Charles N"], "abstract": "Genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 is important for understanding both the\u00a0evolution and the\u00a0patterns of local and global transmission.

We have analyzed SARS-CoV-2 genomes to identify the most variant sites, as well as the stable, conserved ones in samples collected in the Netherlands until June 2020. We identified the most frequent mutations in different geographies. We also performed a phylogenetic study focused on the Netherlands to detect novel variants emerging in the late stages of the pandemic and forming local clusters. We investigated the S and N proteins on SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the Netherlands and found the most variant and stable sites to guide development of diagnostics assays and vaccines. We observed that while the\u00a0SARS-CoV-2 genome has accumulated mutations, diverging from reference sequence, the variation landscape is dominated by four mutations globally, suggesting the current reference does not represent the virus samples circulating currently. In addition, we detected novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 almost unique to the Netherlands that form localized clusters and region-specific sub-populations indicating community spread. We explored SARS-CoV-2 variants in the Netherlands until June 2020 within a global context; our results provide insight into the viral population diversity for localized efforts in tracking the transmission of COVID-19, as well as sequenced-based approaches in diagnostics and therapeutics. We emphasize that little diversity is observed globally in recent samples despite the increased number of mutations relative to the established reference sequence.

SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via airborne droplets ejected from the upper respiratory tract of the infected individuals. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious for hours on surfaces. As such, the stability of viral particles both in liquid droplets as well as dried on surfaces is essential for infectivity. Here we have used atomic force microscopy to examine the structural stability of individual SARS-CoV-2 virus like particles at different temperatures.
